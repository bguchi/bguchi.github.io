As I continue to work on making this blog look and act the way I want it to, I figured that I should also document the resources I've been using along the way: 

[The Git book.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) Version control for blogging and other projects. 

[The Markdown Guide.](https://www.markdownguide.org/) Self-explanatory. 

[Jekyll resources.](https://jekyllrb.com/resources/) Jekyll seems to provide greater control in generating stating websites than using just GitHub Pages.
