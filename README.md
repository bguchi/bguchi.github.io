Welcome to *Session B*, my blog where I post about the research that I've been doing, some personal projects, my job search, and other musings that come up. 

What's with the title? Apart from being catchy (I hope), it's reminiscent of the multiple sessions that have to be run in a well-designed experiment in order to get "good" data. In that way, it's a reminder to myself that things worth doing take time and repeated effort. It's also a reminder of all the work that goes into the "before" and "after" of such "Session Bs", like experimental design and data analysis. Finally, it's a reminder of the future "sessions" - and perhaps entirely new directions - to come. 

In fewer words: I want *Session B* to be a place where I document my exposure to, reflections on, "re-engagements" with, and quilting of the different, interesting ideas I come across.
